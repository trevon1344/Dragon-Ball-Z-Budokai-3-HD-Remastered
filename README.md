# Dragon-Ball-Z-Budokai-3-HD-Remastered
Since I have no idea when I'll be finished with this project, I decided to try something different. You can download all of the ISO files as I update them here.

You can keep up-to-date by checking the "DBZB3HDR Bin List.rtf" file.

What you need:
  - AFS Explorer - In GitHub
  - ImgBurn - In GitHub
  - Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 (Greatest Hits) (USA) - https://mega.nz/#!1UJByQzK!MDPTrpXMrpHzfocPImK4yZSqiv0l1H8Cm7B7XNC-Eow
